# spot-on
Cli tool for downloading spotify tracks from youtube<br>
As of now, supports playlist & album downloads<br>
Results may be invalid, make sure to double check downloads(currently works for most genres, although classical music results are bad)<br>


# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/wdmvv/spot-on
cd spot-on
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage:
```
python3.11 main.py [-h] [--type type] [--path path] [--precise] link
```
<ul>
  <li>-h - program help</li>
  <li>--type - download type, must be either 'album' or 'playlist'</li>
  <li>--path - specify download path, by default creates 'Downloads' dir in workdir</li>
  <li>--precise - enable precise search. It will work slower, but results will be as close to the spotify's ones as possible</li>
  <li>link - spotify playlist/album link, can be either id or link</li>
</ul>

# Examples:
```
python3.11 main.py --type album --path 'Infinite Hyperdeath' https://open.spotify.com/album/0eoB2aUIfAk7a6JBLwyZSj
```
  \- will create folder 'Infinite Hyperdeath' and download album into it
```
python3.11 main.py --precise https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
```
  \- will create folder 'Downloads' and download playlist filtered by duration  into it

# TBD
<ul>
  <li>Add 403 error workaround (given that I find one)</li>
  <li>Threads</li>
</ul>

# Known problem(s)
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes download may fail with following error: `[download] Got error: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`. I assume this is related to youtube doing something on their side since it used to work previously, I may find workaround in the future</li>
</ul>
